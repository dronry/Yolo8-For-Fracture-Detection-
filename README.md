# Yolo8-For-Fracture-Detection-
The proposed model builds upon the YOLOv8-Small object detection architecture and integrates Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM) to improve the modelâ€™s ability to focus on subtle and discriminative regions in X-ray images, particularly those indicative of bone fractures.
